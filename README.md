#### How to use nuker
Congrats! You've complete the download. Now that you have he file running, enter your bot token (go to the "bot" section for info). Now choose what nuke option you want to run based on the number. Once you are done you can use another nuke option by going to the folder and running the exe file; I suggest you pin it to taskbar
